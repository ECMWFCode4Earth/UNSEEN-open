2.2 Independence
================
Timo Kelder
June 4, 2020

In this notebook, we test whether the ensemble members are independent,
based on [Kelder et al. 2020](https://eartharxiv.org/hyxeq/).

## Import data and packages

The data is downloaded from CDS. see the Notebooks of the first step of
the workflow. In notebook [2.1Convert](2.1Convert.md), we load the SEAS5
and EOBS netcdf files and convert them to dataframes, that can be used
in R. Here, we load the dataframes.

``` r
EOBS_UK_weighted_df <- read.csv("../../Data/EOBS_UK_weighted_df.csv", row.names = 1)
SEAS5_UK_weighted_df <- read.csv("../../Data/SEAS5_UK_weighted_df.csv", row.names = 1)
```

SEAS5 contains:

  - Member: 0-24
  - Year: 1982-2016
  - Leadtime: 2-6

An example how SEAS5 can be indexed:

``` r
## Indexing the data
member <- 0 # (0:24)
leadtime <- 2 # 2:6
Member0_ld2 <- SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Precipitation[SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Member == member & SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Leadtime == leadtime]
Member1_ld2 <- SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Precipitation[SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Member == member + 1 & SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Leadtime == leadtime]
```

\#\#Indepence testing between the first en second member

See the paper: this is an example of testing between two members.

``` r
# Test the correlation Between Use spearman to avoid normality assumptions
cor_coeff <- "spearman"
correlation <- cor.test(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2, alternative = "two.sided", method = cor_coeff)

## And plot the correlation for these two members
par(mar = c(4.5, 5.1, 2.1, 2.1), cex.axis = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5, cex.main = 1.5)
plot(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2,
  xlim = c(min(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2), max(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2)), 
  ylim = c(min(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2), max(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2)),
  xlab = "Leadtime 2 member 00 (mm)", ylab = "Leadtime 2 member 01 (mm)"
)
lines(c(0, 6), c(0, 6))
text(2 * min(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2), 0.8 * max(Member0_ld2, Member1_ld2),
  bquote(atop(
    "Spearman" ~ rho == .(round(correlation$estimate, digits = 3)),
    "p value" == .(round(correlation$p.value, digits = 3))
  )),
  cex = 1.3
)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("1:1 line"), lty = 1, cex = 1.3)
```

## Independence testing for all ensemble members

In total, there are 300 distinct pairings for each lead time. Here we
calculate the ρ values for each pair.

``` r
Independence_test <- function(ensemble) {

  ## Perform the pairwise test
  correlations_lds <- array(dim = c(25, 25, 5), dimnames = list(as.character(0:24), as.character(0:24), as.character(2:6))) # create and array to fill the correlations in
  # lds, mbmrs
  for (ld in 2:6) {
    for (mbr1 in 0:24) { #### Number 24 is missing!!
      for (mbr2 in 0:24) {
        if (mbr1 > mbr2) { ## Only calculate this for the top half of the correlation matrix, as not to duplicate any values -> avoid correlating mbr 1 with mbr2 and then mbr2 with mbr 1.
          predictant <- ensemble$Precipitation[ensemble$Member == mbr1 & ensemble$Leadtime == ld]
          predictor <- ensemble$Precipitation[ensemble$Member == mbr2 & ensemble$Leadtime == ld]

          correlations_lds[as.character(mbr1), as.character(mbr2), as.character(ld)] <- cor(predictant, predictor, method = cor_coeff)
        }
      }
    }
  }

  # Check where the correlation is the same as the one estimated in the previous chunk
  # correlations_lds['1','0','7']==correlation$estimate

  ## And plot the result
  par(mar = c(4.5, 5.1, 2.1, 2.1), cex.axis = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5, cex.main = 1.5)
  boxplot(list(correlations_lds[, , "2"], correlations_lds[, , "3"], correlations_lds[, , "4"], correlations_lds[, , "5"], correlations_lds[, , "6"]),
    # range=0, #box whiskers to be the data extremes
    xaxt = "n", xlab = "Lead time", ylab = bquote("Spearman" ~ rho)
  )
  Axis(side = 1, at = 1:6, labels = c(as.character(2:6), "all"))

  return(correlations_lds)
}

correlations_lds <- Independence_test(ensemble = SEAS5_UK_weighted_df)
```

## Bootstrap test

To test whether the correlations are significant, we perform a bootstrap
test.

This takes long to runnn\!\!\!\!\!

``` r
# The correlation test is complex.
# Step one: we test one member to another member, n= length of record over years. For example, we have 35 data point, one for each year, over 1982-2016. n=35
# ensemble = SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Precipitation
# n = 35

Bootstrap_step1 <- function(ensemble, n) {
  ensemble_resampled1 <- sample(x = ensemble, size = n, replace = TRUE) # First, resample to make the data uncorrelated
  ensemble_resampled2 <- sample(x = ensemble, size = n, replace = TRUE) # First, resample to make the data uncorrelated
  return(cor(ensemble_resampled1, ensemble_resampled2, method = cor_coeff))
}

## Step two: We perform this test for each distinct member. We have 25 members, making 300 distinct pairs.
# We have to replicate this in the bootstrap. So we repeat step one 300 times.
Bootstrap_step2 <- function(ensemble, n) {
  distinct_ensembles <- (25 - 1) * 25 / 2 # 300
  cors <- replicate(distinct_ensembles, Bootstrap_step1(ensemble = ensemble, n = n))
  return(unlist(boxplot(cors,
    range = 0, # box whiskers to be the data extremes
    plot = F
  )$stats))
}

correlations_boxstats <- replicate(10000, Bootstrap_step2(ensemble = SEAS5_UK_weighted_df$Precipitation, n = 35))

Quantiles <- c(0.025, 0.975)
Quantiles_fun <- function(x) {
  quantile(x, Quantiles, na.rm = T)
}
CI_bounds_boxplots <- apply(correlations_boxstats[, , ], MARGIN = 1, Quantiles_fun) # We resample 1000 times for 4 leadtimes. Resulting in 4000 quantiles based on 300 pairs of correlations.

saveRDS(CI_bounds_boxplots, file = "../../Data/CI_bounds_boxplots.rds")
# readRDS(file = "my_data.rds")
```

## Plot

``` r
## And plot
## Load the data from the previous chunk
CI_bounds_boxplots <- readRDS(file = "../../Data/CI_bounds_boxplots.rds")


# pdf('../../graphs/Independence.pdf',width = 10, height = 4)

# par(mfrow=c(1,2),mar=c(4.5,5.1,2.1,2.1),cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab=1.5,cex.main=1.5)
boxplot(list(correlations_lds[, , "2"], correlations_lds[, , "3"], correlations_lds[, , "4"], correlations_lds[, , "5"], correlations_lds[, , "6"]),
  # range=0, #box whiskers to be the data extremes
  xaxt = "n", xlab = "Lead time", ylab = bquote("Spearman" ~ rho)
)
for (i in 1:length(CI_bounds_boxplots[1, ])) {
  polygon(c(0, 6, 6, 0), c(rep(CI_bounds_boxplots[1, i], 2), rep(CI_bounds_boxplots[2, i], 2)), col = gray(0.8, alpha = 0.3))
}
Axis(side = 1, at = 1:6, labels = c(as.character(2:6), "all"))
